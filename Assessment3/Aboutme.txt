I’m not just learning technology but I’m rebuilding myself through it. I started with doubts and confusion, but instead of stepping back, I decided to go deeper. When I touch something like Linux, Git, shell scripting, networking, operating systems, or full-stack development, I don’t want surface-level answers; I want to understand the mechanics behind it. Errors don’t stop me but they trigger me to investigate. Even when I feel behind, I push myself to strengthen my fundamentals and think like a real engineer. I’m in the process of transforming from someone who questions his capability into someone who can design, debug, and build systems with confidence and clarity.
